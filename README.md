# ObjectDB
Simple File-Based Database for Storing Data Structures Into Build-In Python Formats.

# Introduction
This project is heavily inspired by TinyDB, which is also a file-based storage manager. However, it is intended for storing single values in a dictionary format, while ObjectDB stores complex data structures in more of a relational database style.
